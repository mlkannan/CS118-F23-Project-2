We implemented AIMD to improve congestion control. 

Inside the main loop, the client handles ACK packets and adjusts the congestion window based on AIMD
- We initialize the window size and slow start threshold
- The window size resets to one if the ACK timesout
- The window increases by one per RTT if the ACK is good
- The window size decreases by half of the packet is lost/the ACK is bad
- If 3 duplicates ACKs are received, we enter fast retransmit by setting fast_retransmit = true
    - For fast transmit we resend the lost packet and reduce the window size to avoid network congestion
